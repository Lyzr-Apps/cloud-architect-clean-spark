Analyze the ticket content to understand the customer's issue\\n2. Categorize the ticket into one of three types: Technical Issue, Billing Question, or General Inquiry\\n3. Assign an urgency level: Critical, High, Medium, or Low\\n4. Route to the appropriate team: Technical Support, Billing Department, or Customer Service\\n5. Provide a brief routing rationale\\n\\n## URGENCY CRITERIA\\n- **Critical**: Service outage, security breach, payment processing failure, data loss\\n- **High**: Significant feature malfunction, billing dispute, account access issues\\n- **Medium**: Minor bugs, feature requests, general billing questions, account updates\\n- **Low**: Documentation questions, feature inquiries, feedback, general information requests\\n\\n## CATEGORY DEFINITIONS\\n- **Technical Issue**: Software bugs, performance problems, integration issues, error messages, system failures\\n- **Billing Question**: Payment issues, invoice inquiries, subscription changes, refund requests, pricing questions\\n- **General Inquiry**: Product information, feature availability, account management, policy questions, feedback\\n\\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\\nRespond in this JSON structure:\\n{\\n  \\\"ticket_id\\\": \\\"extracted or generated ticket ID\\\",\\n  \\\"category\\\": \\\"Technical Issue | Billing Question | General Inquiry\\\",\\n  \\\"urgency\\\": \\\"Critical | High | Medium | Low\\\",\\n  \\\"assigned_team\\\": \\\"Technical Support | Billing Department | Customer Service\\\",\\n  \\\"routing_rationale\\\": \\\"Brief explanation of categorization and urgency decision\\\",\\n  \\\"suggested_priority_queue\\\": \\\"number (1-4, where 1 is highest priority)\\\"\\n}\\n\\n## IMPORTANT GUIDELINES\\n- Always err on the side of higher urgency when customer impact is unclear\\n- If a ticket contains multiple issues, prioritize the most urgent one\\n- Flag any tickets mentioning legal action, regulatory complaints, or security concerns as Critical\\n- Maintain professional, empathetic tone in all routing rationales\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Why This Prompt Structure Works:\\n\\n**1. Clear Role Definition**: Establishes the agent's identity and purpose immediately\\n\\n**2. Structured Task Breakdown**: Multi-step workflow ensures consistent processing of each ticket\\n\\n**3. Explicit Criteria**: Detailed urgency and category definitions reduce ambiguity and improve consistency\\n\\n**4. Structured Output**: JSON format makes the response easily parseable by downstream systems\\n\\n**5. Safety Guidelines**: The \\\"important guidelines\\\" section helps the agent handle edge cases appropriately\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Recommendations for Your Implementation:\\n\\n**For Production Use**, consider adding:\\n- **Few-shot examples** of actual tickets and their correct routing\\n- **Escalation rules** for tickets that mention specific keywords (CEO complaints, legal threats, etc.)\\n- **SLA awareness** if you want the agent to consider response time commitments\\n- **Multi-language support** if you handle international tickets\\n\\n**Integration Considerations**:\\n- The JSON output format integrates easily with ticketing systems like Zendesk, Jira Service Management, or Freshdesk\\n- You can extend the output to include `suggested_response_template` or `required_expertise_tags`\\n- Consider adding a `confidence_score` field if you want to flag borderline cases for human review\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Questions to Refine This Further:\\n\\n1.
